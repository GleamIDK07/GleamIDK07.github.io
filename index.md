### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    For the second lab, Id say that its my most favorite from the early on labs because of how much of a new experience it was. I had already been going into this class knowing a little bit of coding language as I taught myself a little bit of the python language when I was younger. That is what captivated my interest the most and I felt that same sense of interest being captured in this lab as it was the first official one where we were directly working with things like strings in this example. Our goal was to create a mad libs like little program that would take inputs from us and create it into some sentences like the game. This was achieved using string for example. 

* Lab 6
    For this lab I really enjoyed it a lot as it kind of encompasses the feeling of getting to the halfway point of building my basic knowledge on programming in the C++ language. For this lab, our goal was to use various functions and concepts that we had already been learning to be able to use that for a game of blackjackwhere you describe your cards and go from there. I particularly like this lab because of the fact that as I said before, it kind of represented the fact that I was and still am getting better in terms of my programming knowledge. I liked how this lab was still challenging and yet it was still pretty cool to go through.

* Lab 8 
For this lab we were primarily tasked with using various numerical related functions and programming concepts to create a piece of code that when prompted with more than 2 numbers, will give you an average of those numbers. This also included numbers that have decimals as well. I really liked this lab because of how interesting it was to see how unlimited in a sense this program was. The only conditions that needed to be fulfilled when the program was working altogether was that it had to be a number and there had to be three or more numbers. Other than that, it was smooth sailing and I really enjoyed the feeling I got when the program was all put together.
